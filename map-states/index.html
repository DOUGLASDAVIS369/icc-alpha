        <p>The Rome Statute took effect on 1 July 2002 upon ratification by 60 States, officially establishing the ICC. Since it has no retroactive jurisdiction, the ICC deals with crimes committed on or after this date.</p>

        <p>Over 120 countries are States Parties to the Rome Statute. 
      States Parties support the Court, accept the ICC’s jurisdiction, and also work to incorporate the laws stipulated in the Rome Statute into their own judicial systems. Thus, each country that becomes a State Party brings us closer to universal protection under the Rome Statute system.</p>

      <p>States Parties to the Rome Statute gather at least once a year at sessions of the Assembly of States Parties, to provide the management oversight for the Court, for example, by establishing the budget, providing funding and also electing the Court’s judges and Prosecutor.</p>
