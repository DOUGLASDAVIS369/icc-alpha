		<h1>How the ICC works</h1>
		<p class="lede">The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates, prosecutes and tries individuals accused of committing the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: <a href="#genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="#crimes">crimes against humanity</a> and <a href="#war-crimes">war crimes</a>.</p>
		<p class="lede">It was established in 2002 by a treaty called the Rome Statute. This treaty sets out the crimes falling within the ICC’s jurisdiction, the rules of procedure and how states cooperate with the ICC.</p>
		<p class="lede"><a href="#states-parties">Over 120 countries have signed this treaty and become so-called “States Parties” to the Rome Statute.</a> States Parties support the Court, accept the ICC’s jurisdiction, and also work to incorporate the treaty’s laws into their own judicial systems.</p>
		<p class="lede">The ICC is an independent, judicial organisation composed of judges and staff from around the world. It is a permanent international court and not part of the UN system. Its headquarters are in The Hague and it has field offices in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.</p>

			<h2>1. Why and how a case starts</h2>
			<p>The Court’s mandate is to try individuals - rather than States - for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. <em>The Rome Statute</em> and <em>Elements of Crimes</em> defines <strong>four</strong> such crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction.</p>
			<div class="line">
				<div class="right">
					<h2 class="gamma" id="crimes">Crimes against humanity</h2> 
						<p><em>Acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population.</em></p>
						<p>Forcible transfer of population is a crime against humanity. This image is of a woman living in Kassab Camp for Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Kutum, North Darfur, 2012.</p>

			<div class="line">
				<div class="left">
					<h2 class="gamma" id="war-crimes">War crimes</h2> 
					<p><em>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.</em></p>
					<p>Mutilation is a war crime. Konsi was mutilated in the context of the conflict in northern Uganda. She was thereafter abandoned by her husband to raise their three children alone, and stigmatized by her community. The Trust Fund for Victims supported her surgery for her nose, forehead, and upper lip.</p>

			<p><em>Acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.</em></p>
			<p>Example?</p>
		</div>
			<p><a href="#">See the full definition of genoside in <em>Elements of Crimes</em></a></p>
			<div class="line">
			<h2 class="gamma">Crime of aggression</h2> 
			<p><em>The planning, preparation, initiation or execution of an act of using armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State.</em></p>
			<p>This crime was adopted in 2010, but jurisdiction over it remains subject to decisions and ratifications by State Parties set to take place in 2017.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section2" class="big-line">
			<h2>2. The Prosecutor begins a preliminary examination</h2>
			<p>The <a href="#">Office of the Prosecutor</a> can begin to examine crimes in four ways:</p>
			<ul class="numbered">
			<li>States Parties to the Rome Statute can refer a situation to the Prosecutor. Five situations - DRC, Uganda, CAR, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali.</li>
			<li>A state which is not a State Party can decide to accept the jurisdiction of the Court.</li>
			<li>The United Nations Security Council can request the Prosecutor to launch an investigation. Two situations - Darfur, Sudan and Libya.</li>
			<li>With prior authorization from the ICC Judges, the Office of the Prosecutor may initiate investigations <em>proprio motu</em> (on its own initiative) based on information received from reliable sources. One situation - Kenya.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/zVH5HVp33hw?rel=0&showinfo=0'></iframe></div></p>
			<p>The Office of the Prosecutor receives information about alleged crimes from a wide range of sources. Between 2002 and 2012, the OTP received nearly 10,000 communications from individuals, groups, States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.</p>
			<p>Once the OTP receives information or a referral, it must determine if the crimes meet the <a href="Article%2015">legal criteria established by the Rome Statute</a> to warrant investigation by the Court.</p>
			<p>The Prosecutor must establish whether the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes have been committed and, if so, whether they were committed after 1 July 2002 (the date the Court was established).</p>
			<p>It must also determine whether any national authorities are conducting a genuine investigation or trial of the alleged perpetrators of the crimes. It must also notify the States Parties and other States which may have jurisdiction of its intention to initiate an investigation. This fundamental principal is known as “complementarity”.</p>
			
			<p>The Office of the Prosecutor sends its investigators to collect evidence in areas where crimes are alleged to have been committed. The investigators must be careful not to create any risk to the victims are witnesses. The Office of the Prosecutor also requests the cooperation and assistance of States and international organisations. The investigators look for evidence of a suspect’s guilt or innocence.</p>
			<p><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/bUgqq9hYdUY?rel=0&showinfo=0'></iframe></div></p>
			<p>The OTP has published information about 19 preliminary examinations.</p>

			<h2>3. Judges verify facts and issue warrant of arrest</h2>
			<p>Only a <a href="#">Pre-Trial Chamber</a> at the ICC has the power to issue a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear. </p>

			<p><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/g4PYLfWKzfk?rel=0&showinfo=0'></iframe></div></p>

			
			<p>The Prosecution provides the judges with information such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The name of the person</li>
				<li>A description of the crimes the person is believed to have committed</li>
				<li>A concise summary of the facts (the acts alleged to be crimes)</li>
				<li>A summary of the evidence against the person</li>
				<li>The reasons why the Prosecution believes that it is necessary to arrest the person</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The judges will only issue a warrant of arrest or summons to appear if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person concerned has committed a crime within the ICC’s jurisdiction.</p>

		<div class="left-2">	
			<h3 class="delta">Arrest warrant</h3>
			<p>The judges will issue a warrant of arrest if it appears necessary to ensure that the person will actually appear at trial, that he or she will not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the Court’s proceedings, or to prevent the person from continuing to commit crimes. </p>

			<p>The judges will issue a summonses to appear if it is satisfied that 
			summonses are sufficient to ensure the suspect’s appearance before the Court. The judges set a date for the initial appearance along with any other conditions. If the suspect fails to comply with any of these obligations, the judges may decide to issue a warrant of arrest.</p>

			<div class="left-2">
			<p>The responsibility to enforce warrants of arrest in all cases lies with States.</p> 

			<p>The <a href="#">Registrar</a> transmits requests for cooperation seeking the arrest and surrender of the suspect to the relevant State or to other States, depending on the decision of the judges in each case.</p>

			<p>States Parties to the Rome Statute have a legal obligation to cooperate with the ICC. If a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate, the Court may refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties.</p>
			
			<p>For a UN Security Council referral, <a href="article%2029%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute">all UN Member States have a duty to cooperate, regardless of whether or not they are a Party to the Statute</a>.</p>

			<p>Once issued, even in cases where arrests are delayed, arrest warrants are valid for life.</p>

			<p>Suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty. They are present in the courtroom during the trial, and they have a right to a public, fair and impartial hearing of their case.</p>

			<p>Suspects have the right to legal assistance. If the suspect does not have the means to pay for it, the Court will assign legal assistance.</p>

			<h3 class="delta">First appearance</h3>
			<p>The suspect’s first appearance before the Court takes place shortly after his or her arrival in The Hague. During the first appearance, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirms the identity of the suspect, ensures that the suspect understands the charges, confirms that language in which the proceedings should be conducted, and sets a date to begin the confirmation of charges hearing.</p>

			<div class="left-2">
				<h3 class="delta">Confirmation of charges</h3>
				<p>At the confirmation of charges hearing – which is not a trial, but a pre-trial hearing – the Prosecution must present sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial. The purpose of the confirmation hearing is to safeguard the rights of suspects by preventing proceedings with insufficient legal basis from being brought against them.</p>
				<p>The suspect’s defence may object to the charges, challenge the Prosecution’s evidence and also present evidence.</p>
				<p>If one or more charge is confirmed, the case is committed to trial before a Trial Chamber.</p>

		<div class="line">	
			<h2 class="gamma">Witnesses at the ICC</h2>
			<p>A witness is a person - an expert, victim or any other person who has witnessed crimes - who testifies before the Court giving a statement as evidence.</p> 
			<p>Witnesses are chosen based on the relevance of their testimony, their reliability and their credibility. Before testifying, each witness makes an undertaking to tell the truth. The judges assess all evidence submitted to determine its relevance or admissibility. The Court can fine or imprison witnesses who give false testimony.</p>
