		<h1>How the Court works</h1>
		<p class="lede">The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates, prosecutes and tries individuals accused of committing the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: <a href="#genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="#crimes">crimes against humanity</a> and <a href="#war-crimes">war crimes</a>.</p>
		<span class="hide-mobile">
		<p class="lede">It was established in 2002 by a treaty called the <a href="#">Rome Statute</a>. This treaty sets out the crimes falling within the ICC’s jurisdiction, the rules of procedure and how states cooperate with the ICC.</p>
		<p class="lede"><a href="#states-parties">Over 120 countries have signed this treaty and become “States Parties” to the Rome Statute.</a> States Parties support the Court, accept the ICC’s jurisdiction, and also work to incorporate the treaty’s laws into their own judicial systems.</p>
		<p class="lede">The ICC is an independent, judicial organisation composed of judges and staff from around the world. It is a permanent international court and not part of the UN system. Its headquarters are in The Hague and it has <a href="#">field offices</a> in several countries where the Court is conducting investigations.</p>
		</span>

		<p class="background italic">Note: The following is an example of the types of proceedings before the ICC. Not all cases follow this order and some cases are far more complex.</p>

			<p>A witness is a person - an expert, victim or any other person who has witnessed crimes - who testifies before the Court giving a statement as evidence.</p> 
			<p>Witnesses are chosen based on the relevance of their testimony, their reliability and their credibility. Before testifying, each witness makes an undertaking to tell the truth. The judges assess all evidence submitted to determine its relevance or admissibility. The Court can fine or imprison witnesses who give false testimony.</p>

			<h2>9. The trial</h2>

			<p><em>NOTE: PANORAMIC OF THE COURTROOM WOULD GO HERE</em></p>

			<!--	

			<h3>Judges</h3>
			<p>A Chamber composed of three judges is assigned to each case. The ICC’s 18 judges are elected by the Assembly of States Parties for their qualifications, impartiality and integrity. They ensure fair trials and render decisions, but also issue arrest warrants or summonses to appear, authorize victims to participate, order witness protection measures, and more. They also elect the ICC President and two Vice-Presidents, who head the Court.</p>
			<h3>Prosecution</h3>
			<p>The Office of the Prosecutor conducts preliminary examinations and investigations, and prosecutes persons for crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction. Like the judges, the Prosecutor is elected by the ASP for a mandate of 9 years, non renewable.</p>
			<h3>Defence</h3>
			<p>The ICC upholds defendants rights: they are presumed innocent until proven guilty after a trial; they have the right to remain silent, to be informed of the charges, to have time to prepare their defence but also to be tried without undue delay, to choose a lawyer, to examine witnesses and present evidence, to have the Prosecutor disclose any potentially mitigating evidence, to have an interpreter and translations as required, and more.</p>
			<h3>Victims and/or their lawyers</h3>
			<p>The Rome Statute grants victims the right to be represented by their own lawyer and have their views and concerns heard in the Courtroom, at all stages of the proceedings, without being a witness for the Prosecution or Defence.</p>
			<h3>Witnesses</h3>
			<p>Expert or eye witnesses can be called by the judges, or by the Prosecution, Defence or Legal Representatives of Victims. If a judge orders protection for a witness, this could include voice and face distortion, or conducting the hearing in closed session. The witness may also testify from a different location by remote video link.</p>
			<h3>Registry</h3>
			<p>The Registry supports the Court through security, translation and interpretation, court records, public information, counsel support, support for victims to participate in proceedings and apply for reparations, general court management, and much more.</p>

			<p>At trial, the Prosecution and Counsel for the Defence have the opportunity to present their case. The Prosecution must present evidence to the Court to prove that the accused person is guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. This evidence may be in the form of documents, other tangible objects, or witness statements. The Prosecution must also disclose to the accused any evidence which may show that he or she is innocent.</p>

			<p>The Prosecution presents its case first and calls witnesses to testify. When the Prosecution has finished examining each witness, the Counsel for the Defence is given the opportunity to also examine the witness.</p>

			<p>Once the Prosecution has presented all its evidence, it is the turn of the accused, with the assistance of his or her counsel, to present his or her defence.</p>
